# HOLPA is a holistic localised performance assessment tool for monitoring agrifood systems. 

This repository includes working versions of HOLPA data processing, analysis and visualisation scripts. These scripts are being updated in line with progress analyzing the findings from a series of HOLPA farm-household level surveys conducted in 8 countries as part of the CGIAR Agroecology initiative. 

The repository include scripts to: 
1 - clean, format and post-classify data to align questions and responses, correct data entry errors, and harmonize question_names (unique ids) and response formats within and across surveys
2 - extract context variables, calculate agroecology adherence indicators, and calculate key performance indicators
3 - visualise data in graphical format.

This is work in progress. Scripts will be updated and improved over the next months. Please do check for updates as you move forward with your own analyses. Do not hesitate to submit your suggestions for improvement to the authors (andrea.sanchez@cgiar.org and s.jones@cgiar.org).
